          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            "I’m a Master’s student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying atmospheric science, with a growing focus on writing clean, well-structured code. I created this site as a way to deliberately improve my technical skills, not just to make things work, but to follow strong programming practices that hold up in research, operations, and across various industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            My academic interests center on weather and atmospheric dynamics, along with building practical computational tools that make complex systems easier to analyze and understand. I’m especially drawn to turning messy or high-dimensional data into something structured, readable, and usable, whether for forecasting, research, or broader applications across the private sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tend to approach problems analytically and reflectively. I value rigor, intellectual honesty, and science-grounded thinking. At the same time, I’m curious about how emerging tools (particularly AI) are reshaping scientific workflows and knowledge work more broadly. I’m interested not only in how these technologies improve efficiency, but also in what they reveal about cognition, reasoning, and decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond technical growth, this site is a space to integrate my interests in science, technology, and deeper questions about meaning, identity, and the human condition. My goal is to build both competence and clarity. I am trying my best to use structured thinking, careful development, and ongoing iteration to narrow the gap between curiosity and understanding - I hope you will join me on that journey!
