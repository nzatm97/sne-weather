# Southern New England Weather — 24-Hour Build + Launch Playbook

This document is your business/operations playbook paired with the codebase. It is designed to help you move from MVP to traffic and revenue with practical, immediate next steps.

## What this is for

- Pairing product execution with business execution from day one.
- Turning a weather MVP into a side business with repeatable growth loops.
- Reducing tax/compliance mistakes while you scale revenue.

## 1) A 24-hour build and launch plan

### Hours 0-2: Finalize launch-ready product

1. Confirm brand voice and visual identity (now aligned to Southern New England).
2. Add favicon/logo and metadata for sharing snippets.
3. Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.

### Hours 2-6: Build retention hooks

1. Add severe-weather alert banner.
2. Add favorite locations (local storage).
3. Add marine/tide module for coastal utility.
4. Add one-click model comparison mode.

### Hours 6-12: Begin audience generation

1. Create social channels and post 2x/day forecast recaps.
2. Publish SEO pages for each priority city intent.
3. Start a daily email: "Tomorrow in 60 seconds."
4. Share locally in community groups and niche forums.

### Hours 12-24: Start monetization tests

## 3) Basic legal/compliance checklist

> Not legal or tax advice. Use a CPA and attorney licensed in your state.

1. Form an LLC (or other suitable entity) and separate personal/business finances.
2. Open business banking + dedicated card.
3. Keep clean books monthly (income, expenses, payouts).
4. Save a set percentage for taxes and verify with your CPA.
5. Pay quarterly estimated taxes when required.
6. Keep sponsor and affiliate agreements documented.
7. Publish core policies/disclosures:
   - privacy policy
   - cookie disclosure
   - affiliate disclosure
   - terms + limitation of liability

## 4) Trust/data messaging + next product priorities

### Trust/data messaging

1. Show data source + selected model directly in UI.
2. Show update timestamp each refresh.
3. Explain model differences briefly for non-expert users.
4. Add confidence framing by forecast horizon.

### Next product priorities

1. Severe weather alert feed and escalation UX.
2. Radar/map visualization module.
3. Saved preferences + account layer.
4. Engagement analytics dashboards.
5. Revenue placements that preserve experience quality.

## 5) Practical access needed for continued development

You do **not** need to share full machine access. These are the useful scoped permissions:

1. **Repository access** (GitHub/GitLab) for branch-based delivery.
2. **Hosting/deploy access** (Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare) for release workflows.
3. **Domain/DNS access** for production routing.
4. **Analytics access** (Plausible or GA4) for product iteration.
5. **Optional Stripe access** for premium subscriptions and billing tests.

Best practice: use scoped collaborator accounts, least privilege, and avoid sharing personal root credentials.
